# ATOS-Project

This repo was created to gain an understanding of creating a database through SQL Workbench and then being able to make changes to that database through java. Some of the features that were added were,

- Update A customer in the system
- Delete a customer in the system 
- view all customers in the system 
- Delete A customer in the system

In this example I made a sample of a burger shop and created a database that would allow me to add a customer and would also add what type of burger the customer would want to the database.

Junit testing was also carried out to enure that atleast 60% coverage has been achieved. 

The last thing was changing the java file to a JAR file so that the application could be run through the command prompt.
